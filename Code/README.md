eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis Ver 2.0 Code

Per the request of the product owner, the system code will not be given, nor will the database. This means that any functions added into the MVC system, will not be available, unless given permission from the product owner to download from the Affective Social Computing Laboratory's Repository. If granted permission, the instructions are available along with a complete installation guide in the Project Documentation Folder, inside the FinalProjectDocumentation.pdf file. However, many of the results page user stories required HTML code to be injected into web frameworks, using content elements in the survey editor. This code is available. 

This directory has sub directions with the name of the user stories that was completed during this iteration.  The html code, along with corresponding controllers and services are located in these folders. 

For further information about how an administrator should use eEVA, and how the components should be installed to begin working on the system, please view the created videos in the "video" folder
