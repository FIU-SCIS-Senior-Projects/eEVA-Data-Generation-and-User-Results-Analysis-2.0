eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis 2.0

eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis Ver 2.0 was developed in Spring 2017 by Andy Regueira and Emmanuel Henley.

We worked to complete user stories related to the remaining sections of eEVA, as well as user stories pretaining to the initial counselor selection menu and the in session counselor selection menu. There are 5 folders for eEVA Results ver 2.0, and the directory structure is as follows:

Code - All the code for this project
Documents - Project Documentation (Which contains the Final Project Documentation and the User Manual and Installation Guide in its Appendices), and the Meeting Minutes (Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective, and Sprint Review)
Posters- The posters for each student
Presentation Slides - The PowerPoint presentation for eEVA
Videos- Contains an index.html file with links to all 4 videos (an Introduction, Admin User Guide, Installation User Guide, and a Shortcomings/Wishlist)
